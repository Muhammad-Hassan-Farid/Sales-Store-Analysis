# Sales Store Analysis

In this project, we clean, process and analyze the data from excel file, and find the insights in the data.
## Screenshots

### Before Cleaning:
Before Cleaning there was some issues in gender and QTY column.
In gender column there was some 'W' for women and 'M' for Men, also in QTY column there was One for '1' and Two for '2'. Nothing wrong with that but I need these in correct for further processing.
